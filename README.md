#### Skeleton 

#### Wireframes

Wireframe for desktop and mobile - [View](/assets/images/mrdhruvparikh_wireframes.pdf)


#### Surface

The overall aesthetic of the site will be profession, clear and modern. Navbar, footers, text sizes and fonts, colours and buttons will all be unified for easy navigation and understanding. Where large bodies of texts are required these will be broken up with 'read more' options. 

Icons are used alongside titles to convey clarity of meaning and focus attention. 

#### Colour Scheme

The site will utilise blue/gray tone with images and clear grayscale text to evoke a professional modern brand. 

#### Typography

The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the site with Sans Serif as the fallback font should the site fail to load correctly. Roboto is a clean and widely used font on websites. Using a light font-weight gives a further professional appearance.

#### Imagery

The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, clinical aesthetic. Further images are used throughout the site to provide focus for content, for example on the 'Conditions' pages. All a unified by muted blue/grey tones.
